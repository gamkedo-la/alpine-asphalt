"Yo, hope y'all tucked in real nice sippin' cocoa up here in the mountains snuggled in with someone special. It's expected to be a real cold one tonight.  Might see some snow later.  We gotta real special lineup coming up for ya.  Nothing but the best silky smooth tunes in store.  You're listening to J95 The Vibe.  Smooth jazz all night long!"

"Are you all feeling the energy today!  I don't know.  It's something in this clean mountain air.  I'm feeling like I might hit the track later and try some high speed turns! I hear there is a big race coming up and thinking of throwing my keys in the ring.  We got some great beats coming up for you. You're listening to TEK 104.7 The Beat. Only the best vibes 24-7"

(Heavy Metal)
"Ah man! Lost a big race yesterday.  I was about to win if it wasn't for that driver who smashed into me on the last turn.  Made me totally lose control both of myself and the car!  Got some real angsty tunes coming up for you.  You're listening to HM 106.5 The Smash.
